### Interllectual property

> Without that legal right, you would just be stealing other people's **<u>*intellectual property*</u>.** That would just be *lazy*.

### lose a lawsuit

### snippets

### copyleft

> [What is copyleft?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-is-copyleft)

### non starter

> Again, the CC-BY-SA 3.0 is not recommended for use in software, so licensing your software under CC-BY-SA 3.0 is pretty much a **<u>*non-starter.*</u>**

### permissive or proprietary codebase

> If you are working on a permissive or proprietary codebase, you have four options.

### devoid of

> Some of the answers may devoid of explanation and be composed of nothing more than code.

### languish

> The more "modern" answers usually don't get as many votes and tend to languish on the bottom of the page.

### Ready-made

> Therefore, on Stack Overflow, it is hard to *<u>**stumble upon ready-made**</u>* programs ready for you to copy and paste blindly.

### vomit

> On Stack Overflow, code is designed to solve unique and specialized problems, not just vomit out a complete, working program.

### Fully-fledged

> Most of them are *not* code snippets...after all, they are usually fully-fledged working programs, not one or two lines of code.

### derivative work

>  Translating the code in question into another language would also count as a **<u>*derivative work*</u>**, so you would still have to comply with the terms of the CC-BY-SA 3.0 license.

### effortlessly

> Save links **<u>*effortlessly*</u>**.
> View them later, from anywhere.

### jurisdiction

> The exact definition varies based on <u>***jurisdiction***</u>, but the essence is this: the author of a work has a limited monopoly on the copying (hence the term "copyright"), performance, etc. of the work.

### Canonical definition

> The GNU Project gives this [simple definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) of copyleft: "the rule that when redistributing the program, you cannot add restrictions to deny other people the central freedoms [of free software]." This can be considered the canonical definition, since the [GNU General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) (GPL) in its various versions remains the most widely-used copyleft license.

### Bear with me

> **<u>*Bear with me*</u>**, but there's one more step to take before we discuss what copyleft is.
