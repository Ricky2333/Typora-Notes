# StackOverFlow Tutorial

## Intro

> **Stack Overflow** is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers. It's built and run *by you* as part of the [Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/) network of Q&A sites. With your help, we're working together to build a library of detailed, high-quality answers to every question about programming.

## Ideal Steps

1. Write down some notes about the code from Stack Overflow, specifically how it works, how you should implement it, etc.
2. Close the web browser.
3. Wait a few minutes so that you forget the code.
4. Use the information in your notes to re-implement the Stack Overflow code in question.
5. You now own the copyright to your code in question...even if the final code is *exactly the same* as the original Stack Overflow answer. Since you now own the copyright to this code, you may integrate it into your permissive or proprietary codebase.

## Leave links in your Comments

1. The person has helped you greatly by giving you some valuable code. You should reward them by giving the programmer a comment in a codebase that they are never ever going to see.
2. It's useful to look back at the answer in case you need to debug the code later. This is very useful if the author of the code in question also wrote a detailed explanation of his code.

[What is copyleft?](https://opensource.com/resources/what-is-copyleft)

> *I prefer to think of the distinction in this way: permissive licenses provide the maximum freedom to the immediate downstream developers (including the ability to use the open source code in a closed source project), whereas copyleft licenses provide the maximum freedom through to the end users.*
